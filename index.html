                                <h4>The Tool</h4>
                                <p>NEURALSIGHT system is a combination of YOLOv5 trained model and a set of endpoints
                                    that allows users to detect 14 Chest X-ray pathologies. The model is trained using
                                    a VinBig dataset of X-ray images and annotations of the 14 pathologies of interest.
                                    The model is able to predict bounding boxes and class probabilities for each object
                                    (pathology) in an image. The endpoints allow users to perform tasks such as logging
                                    in and uploading images for prediction, as well as viewing and downloading the
                                    prediction results and reports. The model is already trained hence the users only
                                    require to upload their XRAY images and be able to get response as the prediction
                                    and reports. The model has been evaluated on a test dataset and has shown to have
                                    good performance in terms of metrics such as average precision and mean average

                                <h4>Dataset Description</h4>
                                <p>For this dataset, the main aim was to come up with an object classifying system for
                                    common thoracic lung diseases and localizing critical findings. This is an object
                                    detection and classification problem. The images are in png file with difference
                                    dimensions i.e 1024, 216 and 512. In this project, Images that were used were the
                                    one with 512 dimensions.
                                <h4>Dataset information</h4>
                                <p>The dataset comprises 67914 annotated and those not annotated images where there was
                                    only 4394 unique patients images that were annotated  for posterior-anterior (PA) Xrays
                                    scans in PNG format. All images were labeled by a panel of experienced radiologists
                                    for the presence of 14 critical radiographic findings as listed below:</p>

                                <h4>Data preprocessing</h4>
                                <p>The Model (YOLOv5) requires specific data preprocessing steps in order to work
                                    effectively. In this case, we were to process our information to meets this standard.
                                    The following is a detailed workflow documentation of the data preprocessing steps
                                    that were taken in this particular case:<br />

                                    The main difference between GroupKFold and other cross-validation techniques like
                                    train_test_split is that it helped takes into account pathologies or labels for each
                                    class in the sample split equally. i.e, Since some pathologies had more class Distribution
                                    than others, It helped us ensure that the samples from one class label of pathology
                                    do not end up in the same group and are equally Distributed in both groups. For this
                                    project, since the data is split into 5 folds, 1/5 (or 20%) of the data will be used
                                    as the test set, while 4/5 (or 80%) will be used as the training set.<br />
                                </p>

                                <h4>Preparation of dataset Structure for modelling.</h4>
                                <p>To structure the images and labels for YOLOv5 training, We created the following 4
                                    directories where the training and validation information was to reside.</p>
                                <pre class="brush: html">
                                    1. `/WORKING_DIR/PROJECT_DIR/labels/train` - This directory will store the labels (annotations) for the training images.

                                    2. `/WORKING_DIR/PROJECT_DIR/labels/val` - This directory will store the labels (annotations) for the validation images.

                                    3. `/WORKING_DIR/PROJECT_DIR/images/train` - This directory will store the training images.

                                    4. `/WORKING_DIR/PROJECT_DIR/images/val` - This directory will store the validation images.
                                </pre>

                                <p>Once the directories were created, We then moved or copy the images and their
                                    corresponding labels to the appropriate directories. The labels for each image
                                    should have the same file name as the image, and should be placed in the appropriate
                                    label directory </p>
                                    <pre class="brush: html">
                                        (either `/WORKING_DIR/PROJECT_DIR/labels/train` or
                                        `/WORKING_DIR/PROJECT_DIR/labels/val`).
                                    </pre>
                                <p>
                                    The labels were also in their own format. Each image had a single text file as labels.
                                    The format of labels for YOLOv5 model used was a plain text file with the same name
                                    as the corresponding image file, and with a `.txt` extension. The file should
                                    contain one line for each object in the image, with the following format:</p>

                                    <li>- Dropping images with `No findings` label: The first step in preprocessing the data
                                    was to drop all images with their label information that had a label called
                                    "No findings" because the label had no any bounding box information which were needed
                                    for model training. This was done to ensure that the model only focuses on images
                                    that contain the other 13 Chest X-ray pathologies of interest.</li>

                                    <li>- Removing overlapping bounding boxes which occurs in the same class using Non-maximum
                                    suppression methods: In order to improve the performance of the model, non-maximum
                                    suppression was used to remove overlapping bounding boxes which occurs in the same
                                    class label. This technique helps to reduce the number of false positives by removing
                                    bounding boxes that have a high overlap with other boxes of the same class. The method
                                    worked as follows.</li>

                                    <li>- Non-maximum suppression(NMS) function is  used for removing overlapping bounding
                                    boxes. The function takes in two inputs: "boxes" and "overlapThresh". The "boxes"
                                    is a list of bounding boxes in the format of (x1, y1, x2, y2) where (x1, y1) is the
                                    top-left corner and (x2, y2) is the bottom-right corner. "overlapThresh" is a threshold
                                        value for the overlap ratio of bounding boxes.</li>

                                    <li>- The function first checks if the input "boxes" is an empty list. If it is, it returns
                                    an empty list. If there are boxes, the function extracts the x and y coordinates of
                                    the top-left corner and bottom-right corner of each box. It then computes the area
                                    of each bounding box and sorts the boxes based on the bottom-right y-coordinate.
                                    Next, the function iterates through each box and compares it with the other boxes
                                    to calculate the ratio of overlap. If the overlap ratio is greater than the threshold,
                                    the function removes that box from the list of boxes to be returned. Finally, the
                                        function returns the remaining boxes as integers.</li>

                                    <li>- Bounding Box information Normalization: The bounding box information were normalized
                                    to standard values between 0 and 1 against the width and height of the image. This
                                    ensures that the bounding box coordinates are consistent regardless of the size of
                                        the input image that a user will feed to the model. It allows us to work on any image size available.</li>

                                    <li>- Calculating the height and width of the bounding box since they are one of the
                                    crucial features that must be fed to the model during training, they are used to
                                    identify where what is the size of the box.</li>

                                    <li>- Training and Validation.
                                    Before Training, We split the data input two in order to validate the model after
                                    training. We used `GroupKFold method to split`. This method is a variation of the
                                    KFold method for cross-validation. It is used to split the data into `k` number of
                                    folds, where `k` in this case, we used k= 5 which means the data will be split into 5 folds.</li>

                                <p>To structure the images and labels for YOLOv5 training, We created the following 4
                                    directories where the training and validation information was to reside.</p>
                            </div>
                            <pre>
                                1. `/WORKING_DIR/PROJECT_DIR/labels/train` - This directory will store the labels (annotations) for the training images.
                                2. `/WORKING_DIR/PROJECT_DIR/labels/val` - This directory will store the labels (annotations) for the validation images.
                                3. `/WORKING_DIR/PROJECT_DIR/images/train` - This directory will store the training images.
                                4. `/WORKING_DIR/PROJECT_DIR/images/val` - This directory will store the validation images.
                            </pre>
                            <p>
                                Once the directories were created, We then moved or copy the images and their corresponding labels to the appropriate directories. The labels for each image should have the same file name as the image, and should be placed in the appropriate labels directory (either `/WORKING_DIR/PROJECT_DIR/labels/train` or `/WORKING_DIR/PROJECT_DIR/labels/val`).
                                The labels were also in their own format. Each image had a single text file as labels. The format of labels for YOLOv5 model used was a plain text file with the same name as the corresponding image file, and with a `.txt` extension. The file should contain one line for each object in the image, with the following format:
                            </p>
                            <pre>

                            </pre>
                            <p>
                                where:
                                <ul>
                                    <li>class_id: An integer representing the class of the object. This should correspond to the class labels in your dataset.</li>
                                    <li>x_center: The x-coordinate of the center of the bounding box, as a fraction of the image width.</li>
                                    <li>y_center: The y-coordinate of the center of the bounding box, as a fraction of the image height.</li>
                                    <li>width: The width of the bounding box, as a fraction of the image width.</li>
                                    <li>height: The height of the bounding box, as a fraction of the image height.</li>

                            Each object should be split in a new line. Here's an example of a label file for an image
